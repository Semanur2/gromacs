Total Interaction Energy Calculation
This script calculates the total interaction energy by combining the short-range Coulombic and Lennard-Jones energy components from the input .xvg file. To compute the total interaction energy, you need to sum the averages of both energy components and combine their uncertainties.

Given Values:
Short-Range Coulombic Energy: −20.5 ± 7.4 kJ/mol
Short-Range Lennard-Jones Energy: −99.1 ± 7.2 kJ/mol
Calculation of Total Interaction Energy:
The total interaction energy is calculated as follows:

xvg.py
xvg.py is a Python script designed to process .xvg files generated by GROMACS, specifically to extract the total interaction energy and its associated error from simulation data. The script calculates the total energy, considering both Coulombic and Lennard-Jones contributions, and provides the propagated error.

Description
This script works with the .xvg file format, which typically contains energy components of a molecular dynamics simulation output, such as short-range Coulombic interactions and Lennard-Jones interactions. The script calculates the total interaction energy, propagates the error, and outputs the result for further analysis.

Features
Input: .xvg file containing energy values over time.
Output: Total interaction energy with propagated error (standard deviation).
Energy Components Processed:
Coulombic Short-range Interaction Energy
Lennard-Jones Short-range Interaction Energy
Error Propagation: The standard formula for error propagation is applied to the energy components to obtain the total error.

Requirements
Python 3.x
numpy library (for numerical calculations)
matplotlib library (for plotting, optional)

Usage
Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from here.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib
Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
Place your .xvg file in the same directory as the script.
Run the script:
python xvg.py

Output
The script will print the total interaction energy and its propagated error to the terminal. 

For example:
Total Interaction Energy: -237.42 ± 28.34 kJ/mol
